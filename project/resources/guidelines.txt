# application guidelines sketch

# approximate project structure
application.py # only is used to initialize the gui and start the local server

captum/ # contains the modified captum implementation that fixed the plotting bug -> dont forget to remove .git folder

models/ # models are places here and than a custom loader is writen to be used by the gui
    - e.g pytorch_cifar/... #

model_weights/ # should contain the corresponding model weights

loaders/ # contains  # preferably loaders should end with _loader.py to be automatically identified
    # use this https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html

    - abstractModelLoader.py # is an abstract class that requires you to
    # implement the get_model() -> torch model and get_input(img: ndarray) -> input

    - modelXYZ_loader.py # extends from abstractModelLoader

tests/ # contains unittests for the code
    -   nice

# GUI REQUIREMENTS
- draw a layout sketch and place it in the gitlab repo
- the loaders in loaders/ should be dynamically loaded when gui is started
    -> use https://stackoverflow.com/questions/547829/how-to-dynamically-load-a-python-class
- should be possible to upload any image
    -> the image should be converted to some sort or rbg 3d array that will be passed to the loader class
- the application should handle errors pretty well like non existing paths, wrong file formats, and so on
